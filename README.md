# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration
## by Oluwatobi Akinboboye


## Dataset

> The Ford GoBike System, often known as Bay Wheels, is a public bike sharing program in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. With approximately 200,000 rides since its debut in 2017, Bay Wheels is the first regional and extensive bicycle sharing system set up in California and along the West Coast of the United States. As of January 2018, it has about 10,000 annual subscribers.

> This data set contains over 180,000 records/information on individual rides taken in the bike-sharing system in February 2019, as well as their monthly individual trip data. With the help of exploratory and explanatory data analysis and visualizations, I intend to obtain a broad overview of the dataset and provide responses to questions about bike excursions.

## Summary of Findings

> This data set contains details on each ride taken in a bike-sharing program that services the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset with 16 columns contains more than 180,000 bike-riding data points. The majority of variables use numeric data types. This data collection will be divided into three main categories:
* trip duration: duration_sec, start_time, end_time
* station info: start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude
* user info (anonymized): bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Finally, this analysis provides a wide summary of the information as well as answers to questions concerning bike trips in San Francisco. Our analysis suggests that the dataset is made up of two key components: subscribers and consumers. It also explains and illustrates the usage of each of these groups of users, indicating that there are considerably more subscribers than consumers.
